# Self-introduction 
My name is Yue, and I am a first-year MACSS student. I don't have prior coding experience, so I will try my best to consume everything and hopefully master the skills to assist future social science research. 

## My hobbies
I like painting, listening to music, and playing with my cat. For sports, I practice figure skating, and my goal is to be able to do Axel jumps. 

## My recommend restaurant

I recommend 
- **Artopolis** A Greek bakery. They have amazing breads and cakes.
- **Kinton Ramen** Pork Spicy Ramen is really good.
- **Aba** A Mediterranean restaraunt

## Summary and reflection

To complete this homework, Git Hub Doc of basic writing and the format of syntax helped me a lot.  The logic behind using these different syntaxs also reflects what programs do-- to tell the machine what to do in their language. I feel it's very interesting to learn different markdowns.
