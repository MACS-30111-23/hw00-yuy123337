# Self introduction 
My name is Yue, and I am a first year MACSS student. I don't have prior coding experience, so I will try my best to consume everything and hopefully master the skills to assit future social science research. 

## My hobbies
I like to painting, listening to music, and playing with my cat. For sports, I practice figure skating, and my goal is to be able to do Axel jumps. 

### My recommend restaraunt

I recommend 
- **Artopolis** It's a Greek backery. They have amazing breads and cakes.
- **Kinton Ramen** Pork Spicy Ramen is really good.
- **Aba** A Mediterranean restaraunt

###### Summary and reflection

To complete this homework, GitHub Doc of basic writing and formating syntax helped me a lot. It gives me a clear understanding of how computer takes the instruction and how it will turn out after processing it. The logic behind using these different syntax also reflect with what programs do-- to tell the machine what to do in their language. I feel it's very interesting to learn different markdowns since it's surprsing and novel to me to see how the result turns out.
